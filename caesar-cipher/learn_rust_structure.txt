Cargo.lock: 
This file is generated by the Rust package manager, Cargo. 
It is used to lock the versions of dependencies for the project, 
ensuring that the same versions are used across different builds. 
It's an essential part of Rust project management.

Cargo.toml: 
This is another key file for Rust projects. 
It's the manifest file that specifies project metadata and dependencies. 
The Cargo.toml file is used to define the project's name, version, dependencies, and other configuration details.

Makefile: A Makefile is typically used to define a set of tasks or commands for building, testing, and managing a project. 
In the context of a Rust project, it's often used to automate tasks like compiling code, running tests, and 
managing the project's build process.

src: 
This directory is likely where the source code of the Rust project is stored. 
Rust source files (with a .rs extension) and any other related code files may be found in this directory.

target: 
The target directory is usually created by Cargo during the build process. 
It's where compiled binary and library files are stored. 
These files are built from the source code in the src directory.
